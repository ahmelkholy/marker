- Transmission network expansion
  - Through the construction of new lines or upgrade the existing facilities
  - Can increase the amount of power that can be traded securely and the number and generators and consumers that can take part in the market
  - Investments should be justified economically
  - Requires coordination

Two drivers for investments in transmission

- Market force—competition
- Regulation—monopoly transmission company needs to be regulated

- Transmission business
  - Rationale of transmission business—generators and users are in different places
  - Transmission is a natural monopoly
  - Transmission is a capital-intensive business
  - Transmission assets has a long life (20-40 or even longer)
  - Transmission investments are irreversible
  - Merchant transmission—commercial companies enter the transmission business

How can we quantify the value of transmission?

– Example 1 (p. 243) which is have this words "8.4.6.2 A third example Let us modify our Borduria–Syldavia example and consider the even greater simplification shown in Figure 8.9, where the load has been divided into a peak level and an off-peak level. The peak period has a duration of 3889 h while the off-peak period lasts 4871 h. For the sake of simplicity, we have assumed that the on-peak and off-peak periods are coincident in the two countries. As discussed above, in order to determine the optimal transmission capacity, we must balance the annual saving in energy costs against the annuitized cost of transmission. While we could carry out this calculation analytically, we will instead compute the components of the cost for various values of the transmission capacity and find which one minimizes the total cost."

- Transmission demand function

  - Example (p. 245) which is have this words "Let us now examine the effect that a transmission capacity of 400 MW has on the markets for electrical energy in Borduria and Syldavia. During off-peak loading conditions, the capacity of the interconnection does not limit the power flow between the two countries. The two markets thus operate as a single market. Generators in Borduria and Syldavia produce 500 and 100 MW respectively. Since there is only 150 MW of load in Borduria, 350 MW flows on the interconnection to Syldavia. The marginal generation costs and hence the prices in Borduria and Syldavia are identical at 15.00 \$/MWh. Therefore, during off-peak conditions, the short-run marginal value of transmission is zero. The congestion surplus or transmission revenue is thus also zero. During peak loading conditions, Bordurian generators produce only 1300 MW because the local load is 900 MW and the transmission capacity is limited to 400 MW. The generators in Syldavia produce 2300 MW. Because of the transmission congestion, prices in the Bordurian and Syldavian markets are set by the local marginal cost of generation at 23.00 \$/MWh and 59.00 \$/MWh respectively. The short-run value of transmission is thus 36.00 $/MWh. During peak loading condition, the hourly congestion surplus is"

- Transmission supply function
  - Example (p. 246) which has the following words "In practice, the actual transmission capacity rarely coincides with its optimal value. The reasons for this discrepancy are easy to understand if we consider the uncertainties that affect the forecasts of demand and prices, the lumpiness of investments in transmission capacity and the legacy of historical investment decisions. Obviously, power system operators run the system on the basis of what the transmission capacity actually is, and not on the basis of what an optimization program says it should be. Since the nodal energy prices and the congestion surplus are determined by the actual network, it is important to study how suboptimality affects revenue recovery. Let us consider our second example where the optimal capacity of the interconnection between Borduria and Syldavia is 800 MW and calculate what the revenue and cost would be if the transmission line was built with a capacity of 900 MW. Assuming that this capacity is made available, the flow is 900 MW. Bordurian generators increase their output to 1400 MW, while production in Syldavia drops to 600 MW. Using Equations (8.1) and (8.2), we find that energy prices in Borduria and Syldavia are 24.00 \$/MWh and 25.00 $/MWh respectively. The short-run value of transmission has dropped from 4.00 \$/MWh for a capacity of 800 MW to 1.00 $/MWh for a capacity of 900 MW."
